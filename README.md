The Movie Seat Booking System is a simple web-based application where users can:

    -> Select a movie from a dropdown menu.
    -> Choose available seats from a seating arrangement.
    -> See the total price based on the selected seats.
    -> Proceed with the booking or cancel their selection.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
